Mission: Infection Prevention (Small game built for assignment three of COMPSCI 105 at the University of Auckland, 2011)

Simple game meant to demonstrate understanding of collision, timers, and to get practice with the Java Swing and AWT APIs.

Simply place all files into the same directory and run "javac *.java" with the chosen directory as the working directory, then run "java A3App" to play!

Movement of your character is controlled by W,A,S,D. The objective is to shoot the "zombies" (red dots) before they come into contact with your character, by aiming at or past them with the mouse.

Sound effects are borrowed from Valve, theme music is my own composition.
